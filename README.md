# python-backup-files
This Python script is a simple file and directory backup utility that utilizes the argparse 
module for command-line argument parsing, Shutile, and os for interacting with the system. It prompts the user to choose between backing up a file or a directory.This is ran via the command line. I'm fairly still a begginner to github still, so I will try and make sure things are nice and neat.
